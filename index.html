            <p>Hello! My name is Seth McNeace and i'm definely am one of a kind. Ive had a tough child hood but I would like to succed by
              succeding in life. Becoming succesful is a big dream of mine but I know its a process. I've understood most things in life
              is a process and I'm going to try my best to become the best. </p>

            <p>Through out highschool and college I've had challenges I had to overcome because I was a student athlete. Playing
              baseball for 16 years of my life really made me into something. It sorta was a great training on how to get stuff done.
              I learn many things through out my career and from now on I will be putting most of my intrest into web devolopement and coding. </p>

            <p>I've always wanted to do something with computers and coding wasnt my first option, but it is something I was going to want
              to learn in the future. If i can make a career out of this than it will probably be my future career for now. 
            </p>
